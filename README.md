# Template Python Project

## Summary

When working with tech and dealing with complex environments it helps to be organised and structured so its easy to share and find projects.

Since I often have the need to work on multiple Python projects I decided to have virtual environments and manage them with Make.

However since I use VSCode with linting, I often need to download packages so that I'm able to use black, boto3 etc.

You could create one large venv for VSCode to use as the default python interpreter but I find it better to keep envs smaller and not risk of packages colliding with each other.

Much of the makefile has been inspired from this [repo](https://gist.github.com/genyrosk/2a6e893ee72fa2737a6df243f6520a6d) so don't forget to say your thanks to the author.

## Prerequisites

This assumes you have the following installed:

- vscode
- pyenv
- pyenv-virtualenv

## Why an API example

The more I think about it I often find myself working around APIs, weather its Google Workspaces or checking the local public transport public data etc.

With this in mind I've added a basic example in the **_main_**.py with API query and response.

I also use and recommend Postman since it allows me to check that I understand the API before implementing it in code.

## Usage

### Global Workspace/Project Env

As much as I don't like using one for many there are cases like with the extension AWS boto3 which needs to be configured on a more generalised level.

1. Install the extension Python Environment Manager.

2. Create a global vscode env.

   ```bash
   pyenv virtualenv PYTHON_VERSION --force vscode-global-PYTHON_VERSION
   ```

3. Select it for each workspace/project so they default to it; "Python: Select Interpreter" and then "select at workspace level" at the bottom.

4. Install AWS boto3 extension.

5. "AWS boto3: Quick Start", by now it'll promt the vscode-global env.

6. "Install" and finally select the desired AWS services.
